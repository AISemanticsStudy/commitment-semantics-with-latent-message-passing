# Commitment Semantics with Latent Message Passing
This repository contains the code and resources for the research project on "Commitment Semantics with Latent Message Passing", a theory try to formalize computational semantics of artificial intelligence and unify the understanding of various AI paradigms and specific models.

## Why project not paper?
The unique view of the theory being developed here follows and uses the concepts and wording wildly used in programming languages, distributed systems, and databases, which makes the theory more accessible to researchers from these fields, and also opens up more engineering-focused practitioners to understand the concepts.
Also we don't want to write a paper for the sake of writing a paper, that forcing the core subject of this theory semantics into the rigid format of one specific mathematical framework or formal system.
So we decided to use a tone between system design documents and semi-philosophical essays to present the ideas and concepts of the theory.

We would like everyone to be a part of the open research process, and we believe that sharing the ideas in an informal manner first will help us gather feedback and improve the theory before formalizing it into academic papers.
Why this is important? We would like to make the theory as theoretical and as structural as possible, so that it can be easily applied to various AI paradigms and models. That's why it is crucial to have a wide range of feedback from different perspectives, especially from those who are working on developing AI inference systems and training new models. We appreciate any feedback if you apply the theory and find interesting results or new methodologies derived from it.

Once the theory is more established and widely accepted, we plan to write formal papers to present the findings in a traditional academic format and submit them to well-suited tracks of conferences and journals.
