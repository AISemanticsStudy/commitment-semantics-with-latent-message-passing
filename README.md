# Commitment Semantics with Latent Message Passing
This repository contains the code and resources for the research project on "Commitment Semantics with Latent Message Passing", a theory try to formalize computational semantics of artificial intelligence and unify the understanding of various AI paradigms and specific models.

## Why project not paper?
The unique view of the theory being developed here follows and uses the concepts and wording wildly used in programming languages, distributed systems, and databases, which makes the theory more accessible to researchers from these fields, and also opens up more engineering-focused practitioners to understand the concepts. We would like everyone to be a part of the open research process, and we believe that sharing the ideas in an informal manner first will help us gather feedback and improve the theory before formalizing it into academic papers.

Once the theory is more established and widely accepted, we plan to write formal papers to present the findings in a traditional academic format and submit them to well-suited tracks of conferences and journals.

## Repository Structure
- `research-log/`: A collection of research notes, experiments, and findings related to the project.
- `blogs/`: Informal blog posts discussing various aspects of commitment semantics and latent message passing.
