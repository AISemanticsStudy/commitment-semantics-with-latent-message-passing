# Commitment Semantics with Latent Message Passing
This repository contains the code and resources for the research project on "Commitment Semantics with Latent Message Passing", a theory try to formalize computational semantics of artificial intelligence and unify the understanding of various AI paradigms and specific models.

## Why project not paper?
The unique view of the theory being developed here follows and uses the concepts and wording wildly used in programming languages, distributed systems, and databases, which makes the theory more accessible to researchers from these fields, and also opens up more engineering-focused practitioners to understand the concepts.
Also we don't want to write a paper for the sake of writing a paper, that forcing the core subject of this theory semantics into the rigid format of one specific mathematical framework or formal system.
So we decided to use a tone between system design documents and semi-philosophical essays to present the ideas and concepts of the theory.

We would like everyone to be a part of the open research process, and we believe that sharing the ideas in an informal manner first will help us gather feedback and improve the theory before formalizing it into academic papers.
Why this is important? We would like to make the theory as theoretical and as structural as possible, so that it can be easily applied to various AI paradigms and models. That's why it is crucial to have a wide range of feedback from different perspectives, especially from those who are working on developing AI inference systems and training new models. We appreciate any feedback if you apply the theory and find interesting results or new methodologies derived from it.

Once the theory is more established and widely accepted, we plan to write formal papers to present the findings in a traditional academic format and submit them to well-suited tracks of conferences and journals of different fields and disciplines.

## Pre-requisites
To fully understand the concepts and ideas presented, we encourage readers to have a minimal understanding of the following topics.
These topics are not strictly required, but they will help readers build natural intuition.

- Consensus algorithms (e.g., Paxos, Raft)
- CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)
- SmallTalk and Erlang programming languages

## LOC
- the core concepts and definitions
- revisiting existing AI paradigms and models from the theory's perspective
- hypothesis and cross-discipline observations derived from the theory


## hypothesis and cross-discipline observations derived from the theory
### origin of animal
support the hypothesis animal with brain could evolve from a fusion of two different single-cell organisms.
One organism


### There is no back-propagation in human brain
The theory suggests that the human brain definitely does not need back-propagation as a learning mechanism.
Using only prune and connect operations on neural linkages (synapses) to adjust the message passing pathways is sufficient for the brain to learn and adapt to new information.

### Neural linkage's robustness

One long standing question in neuroscience is how the brain maintains stable memory and intelligent behavior over sparse neural linkages (synapses) over long periods of time, despite the fact that individual synapses are constantly being formed and pruned. The message passing part of the theory provides a solid explanation for this phenomenon. Because the neural linkage purely serves as a communication channel for passing latent messages, the exact structure and strength of individual synapses are not critical for maintaining the overall functionality of the brain. As long as there are enough synapses to facilitate the necessary message passing, the brain can continue to function effectively, even if individual synapses are lost or weakened over time.

### Human brain has area(s) to store IDR


### Sleep and dreaming
Under the theory, sleep could be understood as a process equivalent to a GPT conducting offline training to update its IDR representation.

### DNA is evolutionary's IDR

### Nature selection and mutation

### Difference between stimulant and psychedelic drugs

stimulant could help prolong
