# Down the rabbit hole

About 3 days ago, I started talking to Gemini about an observation:
the count-off of a rock band.
The count-off is a way for the band members to synchronize their start of playing music together, usually done by the drummer or the band leader counting "1, 2, 3, 4" or "1, 2, 3, go!".
I recognize that the AI as we know today, could not really understand and generate this kind of count-off. But why?
The count-off is encoded with multiple layers of information, at least including:
- the literal meaning of the words,
- the rhythmic pattern implied by the count-off,
- the social convention of how a band coordinates their playing together,
- the emotional tone conveyed by the count-off (e.g., excitement, urgency).
